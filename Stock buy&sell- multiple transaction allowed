Day-7 of GFG160 

Problem: Stock buy and Sell - Multiple Transaction Allowed

Approach: 
we have to find the maximum profit by buying and selling the stocks from given price[] array
- traverse the whole array, and whenever prices[i] > prices[i-1] we just get out profit and add into out return ans.
- prices[i-1] is the buying day and prices[i] is the selling day of stock
- so we maximise our prifit

TC: O(N)
SC: O(1)

CODE:

class Solution {
  public:
    int maximumProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        int ans = 0;
        
        for(int i = 1; i<n; i++){
            if(prices[i]>prices[i-1]){
                ans+= (prices[i] - prices[i-1]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
